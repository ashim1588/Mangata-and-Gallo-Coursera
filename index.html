            Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo.
            After graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond
            cutting and metal smithing, Mariana opened a store in her hometown,
            Austin and started to grow her business online. Mariana has always
            managed every aspect of the business, from jewelry design to
            marketing to e-commerce. However, she recently hired several
            artisans to help craft her designs and a young employee to help
            manage the company website and social media accounts.
